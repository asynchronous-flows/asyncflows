# Introduction

asyncflows is a framework for designing and running AI pipelines using simple YAML configuration.

Here is a simple flow that prompts the LLM to say "hello world", and prints the result.

<div align="center">

<img width="465" alt="hello world" src="https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/assets/24586651/9ef8234d-f0d0-4ea7-a42e-92fe1650c19a">

</div>

YAML file that defines the flow:
```yaml
# hello_world.yaml

default_model:
  model: ollama/llama3
flow:
  hello_world:
    action: prompt
    prompt:
      - text: Can you say hello world for me?
default_output: hello_world.result
```

Python code that runs the flow:
```python
from asyncflows import AsyncFlows

flow = AsyncFlows.from_file("hello_world.yaml")
result = await flow.run()
print(result)
```

Output of the python script:
```python
Hello, world!
```

Run the example yourself with:

```bash
python -m asyncflows.examples.hello_world
```

# Installation

## With pip

Get started with:

```bash
pip install asyncflows
```

Depending on what you need, consider installing **extra dependencies**:

### Model Providers

<details>
<summary>
OpenAI
</summary>

```bash
pip install asyncflows[openai]
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Anthropic
</summary>

```bash
pip install asyncflows[anthropic]
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Google Cloud (Vertex AI)
</summary>

```bash
pip install asyncflows[gcloud]
```

</details>

### SQL Databases

<details>
<summary>
Postgres
</summary>

```bash
pip install asyncflows[pg]
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
SQLite
</summary>

```bash
pip install asyncflows[sqlite]
```

</details>

Any SQL database implemented in [sqlalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html) is supported, 
though you may need to install additional dependencies not shown here. 
Please open an issue if you run into this, 
we will happily add an extra category for your database. 


### Miscellaneous

<details>
<summary>
Retrieve and Rerank
</summary>

```bash
pip install asyncflows[transformers]
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
PDF Extraction
</summary>

```bash
pip install asyncflows[pdf]
```

</details>

## Local development

Create and activate a python3.11 virtual environment with, for example:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If not already installed, [install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
Install dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install
```

To install all extra dependencies, run:

```bash
poetry install --all-extras
```

# Guides

## Using Any Language Model

You may set `api_base` under `default_model` to change the ollama API endpoint:

```yaml
default_model:
  model: ollama/llama3
  api_base: ...
```

Alternatively, you can change the `model` in the corresponding YAML file to e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo` (an OpenAI model), or `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (an Anthropic model).
If you do, run the example with the corresponding api key environment variable.

You may also use any other model available via [litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).
Please note that most litellm models do not have async support, and will block the event loop during inference.

<details>
<summary>
OpenAI Example
</summary>

```yaml
default_model:
  model: gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Running the example with an OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... python -m asyncflows.examples.hello_world
```

</details>



<details>
<summary>
Anthropic Example
</summary>

```yaml
default_model:
  model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
```

Running the example with an Anthropic API key:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... python -m asyncflows.examples.hello_world
```

</details>

# Examples

The examples default to llama3, and assume [ollama](https://ollama.com/) is running locally.  
To use a different model or provider, see [Using Any Language Model](#using-any-language-model).

## De Bono's Six Thinking Hats

[Edward De Bono's Six Thinking Hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats) is a **business intelligence** technique for creative problem-solving and **decision support**.
The concept is based on the idea of using different colored hats to represent different modes of thinking, each focusing on a specific aspect of the problem or decision at hand.

This flow parallelizes the thinking under five hats, and synthesizes them under the blue hat.

<div align="center">
<img width="1079" alt="debono" src="https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/assets/24586651/1a6efeeb-d8b2-41cf-a79b-0ff0b692f3db">

Running the example (will prompt you for something to think about):

python -m asyncflows.examples.debono

3. Create a memory video and fitness-themed gift (e.g. workout outfit).
4. Incorporate black/white desserts and compile a personalized music playlist.
5. Assign tasks, set deadlines. Monitor progress against mom's interests/feedback.
6. Success criteria: Mom feels celebrated in a personalized, meaningful way.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This flow facilitates asking questions over a set of documents.

Given a list of texts, it uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to find the ones relevant to the question, and generates an answer.

The form of RAG we're using is **retrieval** followed by **reranking**.
Retrieval is great for searching through a large dataset, while reranking is slower but better at matching against the query.

<div align="center">
<img width="1104" alt="rag" src="https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/assets/24586651/93e7bade-3ee3-4da8-bf3d-18affdc8f874">

> What's something healthy I could make?

The two provided recipes, Mexican Guacamole and Lebanese Hummus, offer healthy and flavorful options to prepare. The key points are:

1. Guacamole is made by mashing ripe avocados and mixing in fresh vegetables like onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and jalape√±os, along with lime juice and salt. It can be served with tortilla chips or as a topping for tacos.

2. Hummus is a blend of chickpeas, tahini (sesame seed paste), lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil, seasoned with salt and cumin. It is typically served as a dip with warm pita bread and garnished with paprika and parsley.

Both recipes are healthy, vegetarian options that incorporate fresh ingredients and can be easily prepared at home.

## SQL Retrieval

This flow facilitates asking questions over a SQL database.

To use it with your database, install the corresponding [extra packages](#databases) and set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

<div align="center">

## Chatbot (planned)

This flow facilitates a chatbot over a set of documents.

Given a list of filepaths, it extracts their text, uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to find the ones relevant to the question, and generates an answer.

The form of RAG we're using is **retrieval** followed by **reranking**.
Retrieval is great for searching through a large dataset, while reranking is slower but better at matching against the query.

## Writing your own actions

You can create custom actions by subclassing `Action` and defining the input and output models using Pydantic.

Python code for the custom action:
```python
from asyncflows import Action, BaseModel, Field

import aiohttp


class Inputs(BaseModel):
    url: str = Field(
        description="URL of the webpage to GET",
    )


class Outputs(BaseModel):
    result: str = Field(
        description="Text content of the webpage",
    )


class GetURL(Action[Inputs, Outputs]):
    name = "get_url"

    async def run(self, inputs: Inputs) -> Outputs:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(inputs.url) as response:
                return Outputs(result=await response.text())
```

YAML file of an example flow using this action:
```yaml
# get_page_title.yaml

default_model:
  model: ollama/llama3
flow:
  get_website:
    action: get_url
    url: 
      var: url
  extract_title:
    action: prompt
    prompt:
      - heading: Website content
        link: get_website.result
      - text: |
          What is the title of the webpage?
default_output: extract_title.result
```

The title of the webpage is "Python (programming language) - Wikipedia".
