# Introduction

> Building generative AI **demos** is **easy**. Building something that **scales** is **hard**.  

Moving our GenAI pipelines from complex code to declarative config 
has made them **easier to read, conceptualize, and visualize**.

asyncflows crystallized from a **developer** and a **researcher** collaborating
to work on AI. 

## âœ¨ Philosophy

âœ¨ The GenAI landscape is rapidly evolving; we are **platform-agnostic**, and strive to enable the use of any LLM, database, or hosting service.  
âœ¨ Actions are **infinitely configurable** for a wide array of use cases.  
âœ¨ Low-complexity AI pipelines are **transparent** and **readable**.  
âœ¨ asyncflows is designed to be **scalable** and **monitorable**, with built-in **caching** and **logging** of event loop blocking time.  

## ðŸ¥ž Stack

ðŸ¥ž Define pipelines with concise `YAML`.  
ðŸ¥ž Template prompts with `jinja`.  
ðŸ¥ž Parallelize infinitely, on top of vanilla `asyncio`.  
ðŸ¥ž Write actions with strongly-typed inputs and outputs as `pydantic` models.  

## ðŸ‘‹ Getting Started

Here's a flow that extracts **key decisions** and **action items** from **meeting notes**.

We found that separating **structured data generation** into a **generating** step and a **structuring** step [**reduces bias in the output**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01740):

1. Prompt `claude-3.5-sonnet` for a summary of the `meeting_notes`
2. Prompt `gpt-4o` to generate a JSON with key decisions and action items

<div align="center">
<img width="1274" alt="meeting_review" src="https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/meeting-review-example/assets/24586651/6969d507-ab04-49f1-b1fe-3468cf42be78">
</div>

YAML file that defines the flow:

```yaml
# meeting_review.yaml

flow:

  # FIRST, generate an unstructured response
  meeting_review:
    action: prompt
    # Use Claude-3 Opus with a temperature of 1
    model:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
      temperature: 1
    # Prompt the LLM to generate a meeting notes review
    prompt:
      - heading: Meeting Notes
        var: meeting_notes
      - text: |
          Review these meeting notes and identify key decisions and action items.

  # THEN, structure the response
  structure:
    action: prompt
    # Use GPT-4o with a temperature of 0
    model:
      model: gpt-4o
      temperature: 0
    # Prompt the LLM to respond with a list
    prompt:
      - heading: Meeting Notes Review
        link: meeting_review
      - text: |
          Based on the meeting notes review, what are the key decisions and action items? Summarize the main points.
    # Specify a JSONschema for structured output
    output_schema:
      # An example of this output is:
      # {
      #   "key_decisions": ["Decision 1", "Decision 2"],
      #   "action_items": ["Action Item 1", "Action Item 2"]
      # }
      type: object
      properties:
        key_decisions:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
        action_items:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
```

Python code that runs the flow:
```python
from asyncflows import AsyncFlows
import json

# Load the flow
flow = AsyncFlows.from_file("meeting_review.yaml")

# Set the variable
flow = flow.set_vars(
     meeting_notes="We met to discuss project alpha. Jason presented the latest updates on the project. Courtney asked about the timeline for the next milestone. The coffee still needs to be refilled. We agreed to meet again next week to review the progress." 
)

# Run the flow
result = await flow.run('structure.data')

# Print the action items
action_items = result['action_items']
print(json.dumps(action_items, indent=2))
```

Output of the python script:
```json
[
  "Review the progress on project alpha at the next meeting.",
  "Follow up on the timeline for the next milestone (as Courtney inquired about this).",
  "Refill the coffee (as it was noted that this needs to be done)."
]
```

Heya spacie peeps! Its me, Zlorg, yer favret pizza enthusiast from Andromeda! Im here to rite a tale abowt da most tubular pizzas eva sent into da cosmos!

In da year 3050, da Pizza Federation (ya, thats what we call dem) launched its first-ever space-bound pizzaria, aptly named "Crust-ial Velocity." Captain Zara and her trusty crew of pizza artisans, including da infamous topping master, Rizzo, set off on a quest to deliver da most cosmic pies to da galaxy's most distant planets.

First stop: da planet Zorvath, where da alien inhabitants were famished for some good ol' Earth-style pepperoni. Captain Zara and crew whipped up a "Galactic Garage Band" pizza, topped with spicy peppers from da swamps of Saturn, mozzarella from da moon of Ganymede, and a drizzle of da finest olive oil from da vineyards of Mars. Da Zorvathians went wild, chanting "Pizza-za-zee!" in their native tongue.

## De Bono's Six Thinking Hats

[Edward De Bono's Six Thinking Hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats) is a **business intelligence** technique for creative problem-solving and **decision support**.
The concept is based on the idea of using different colored hats to represent different modes of thinking, each focusing on a specific aspect of the problem or decision at hand.

This flow parallelizes the thinking under five hats, and synthesizes them under the blue hat.

<div align="center">

<img width="1079" alt="debono" src="https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/assets/24586651/0768b653-efbf-44ce-b9ae-53dae6266a30">

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This flow facilitates asking questions over a set of documents.

Given a list of texts, it uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to find the ones relevant to the question, and generates an answer.

The form of RAG we're using is **retrieval** followed by **reranking**.
Retrieval is great for searching through a large dataset, while reranking is slower but better at matching against the query.

<div align="center">
<img width="1104" alt="rag" src="https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/assets/24586651/a309f16a-7a84-4d73-be75-c4d0bb5abbe2">

> What's something healthy I could make?

The two provided recipes, Mexican Guacamole and Lebanese Hummus, offer healthy and flavorful options to prepare. The key points are:

1. Guacamole is made by mashing ripe avocados and mixing in fresh vegetables like onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and jalapeÃ±os, along with lime juice and salt. It can be served with tortilla chips or as a topping for tacos.

2. Hummus is a blend of chickpeas, tahini (sesame seed paste), lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil, seasoned with salt and cumin. It is typically served as a dip with warm pita bread and garnished with paprika and parsley.

Both recipes are healthy, vegetarian options that incorporate fresh ingredients and can be easily prepared at home.

> How does the Red Queen's view of punishment shape the story?

The Red Queen's view of punishment is a significant theme that shapes the story of Wonderland. In the Relevant Pages, we see her ordering the beheading of Alice, three gardeners, and others without hesitation or remorse. Her fury is intense, and she screams "Off with her head!" with an air of absolute authority.

The Red Queen's perspective on punishment reveals a stark contrast between her cruel nature and the more benevolent attitudes of other characters, such as the King, who intervenes to save Alice from execution. The Queen's actions also create a sense of danger and chaos, making Wonderland an unpredictable and potentially deadly place for its inhabitants.

3. Unremarkable team with average skills and experience (-2 points)
4. Uninspiring rewards and lackluster influencer partnerships (-2 points)
5. Unclear competitive advantage in the market (-2 points)
6. Moderate funding request without a compelling plan for growth and success (-2 points)

Total Score: -9 points

Based on the provided application, MediocreApp Inc. does not present a compelling case for inclusion in the prestigious startup accelerator. The company's focus on delivering a mediocre experience and maintaining a level of ordinariness is not aligned with the goals of funding innovative and high-potential startups.

The lack of a unique selling proposition and the absence of a clear competitive advantage in the market raise concerns about the company's ability to attract and retain users. The team's average skills and experience further contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the startup's potential for success.

Moreover, the moderate funding request without a compelling plan for growth and success does not instill confidence in the company's ability to effectively utilize the accelerator's resources and support.

Given the limited funding opportunities and the need to select the most promising startups, it is not recommended to include MediocreApp Inc. in the accelerator's portfolio. The application's weaknesses significantly outweigh its strengths, and the company's overall approach does not demonstrate the level of innovation, market potential, and growth prospects required to justify the investment.

In conclusion, considering the competitive nature of the startup accelerator and the responsibility to allocate funds wisely, MediocreApp Inc. does not meet the criteria for inclusion in the program.

Thank you for submitting your application to our prestigious startup accelerator. After carefully reviewing your application and considering the judgement provided, we have identified several areas where your application could be improved to increase your chances of being selected for our program.

Suggestions:
1. Focus on Innovation and Unique Selling Proposition:
Your application currently lacks a strong emphasis on innovation and a clear unique selling proposition. To stand out in a competitive market, it's crucial to highlight how your app offers something truly unique and valuable to users. Instead of aiming for mediocrity, focus on identifying and showcasing the features or benefits that set your app apart from the competition.

2. Target Market and User Engagement:
While you have identified a target market, aiming for users who are content with mediocrity may not be a sustainable approach. Consider repositioning your target market to focus on users who are looking for a specific benefit or solution that your app provides. Demonstrate how your app can engage users and provide them with a compelling reason to continue using it.

3. Team Strengths and Expertise:
The current description of your team suggests average skills and experience. To instill confidence in your startup's ability to execute and succeed, highlight the specific strengths, expertise, and track record of your team members. Emphasize any relevant experience, achievements, or skills that make your team well-suited to tackle the challenges in your market.

4. Competitive Advantage and Market Potential:
Your application would benefit from a clearer articulation of your competitive advantage and the potential of your target market. Conduct thorough market research to identify the size, growth potential, and opportunities within your market. Explain how your app addresses a specific pain point or need better than existing solutions, and provide evidence to support your claims.

5. Growth and Success Strategy:
While you have outlined a revenue model and marketing strategy, your application lacks a compelling plan for growth and success. Provide more details on how you plan to scale your user base, increase revenue, and achieve key milestones. Discuss any partnerships, customer acquisition strategies, or product development plans that will drive your startup's growth.

6. Funding Utilization and Milestones:
Your funding request would be strengthened by providing a more detailed breakdown of how the funds will be utilized and the specific milestones you aim to achieve. Clarify how the funding will be allocated across different areas of your business, such as product development, marketing, and team expansion. Set clear and measurable milestones that demonstrate your startup's progress and potential.

7. Fit with Accelerator's Focus and Values:
Research our accelerator's focus areas, portfolio, and values to ensure that your startup aligns well with our program. Highlight how your app and team fit with our accelerator's objectives and how our resources and support can help you achieve your goals. Demonstrate your commitment to growth, learning, and making a positive impact.

By addressing these areas and refining your application, you can present a stronger case for your startup's potential and increase your chances of being selected for our accelerator program. Focus on showcasing your startup's unique value proposition, market potential, and growth prospects, while emphasizing the strengths of your team and your fit with our accelerator.

We encourage you to revise your application based on this feedback and resubmit it for further consideration. We appreciate your interest in our accelerator program and wish you the best of luck in your entrepreneurial journey.

# Guides

## Custom Actions

[![template repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/template_repo-blue)](https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/api-call-example)

You can create custom actions by subclassing `Action`, and defining the input and output models using Pydantic.

Here is an example action that visits a webpage and returns its text content:

```python
from asyncflows import Action, BaseModel, Field

import aiohttp


class Inputs(BaseModel):
    url: str = Field(
        description="URL of the webpage to GET",
    )


class Outputs(BaseModel):
    result: str = Field(
        description="Text content of the webpage",
    )


class GetURL(Action[Inputs, Outputs]):
    name = "get_url"

    async def run(self, inputs: Inputs) -> Outputs:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(inputs.url) as response:
                return Outputs(result=await response.text())
```

<details>
<summary>

```yaml
# get_page_title.yaml

default_model:
  model: ollama/llama3
flow:
  get_website:
    action: get_url
    url: 
      var: url
  extract_title:
    action: prompt
    prompt:
      - heading: Website content
        link: get_website.result
      - text: |
          What is the title of the webpage?
default_output: extract_title.result
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Running the flow (python and stdout)
</summary>

Python script that runs the flow:
```python
from asyncflows import AsyncFlows

flow = AsyncFlows.from_file("get_page_title.yaml")

# Run the flow and return the default output (result of the extract_title action)
result = await flow.set_vars(
    url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)",
).run()
print(result)
```

Output of the python script:
```
The title of the webpage is "Python (programming language) - Wikipedia".
```

</details>

As long as your custom actions are imported before instantiating the flow,
they will be available for use.

Alternatively, to ensure the action is always available, 
and for it to show up when using the language server for YAML autocomplete,
register an entrypoint for the module that contains your actions.  
For example, using poetry, with your actions located in `my_package.actions`,
include the following at the end of your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.plugins."asyncflows"]
actions = "my_package.actions"
```

See the [API Call Example](https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/api-call-example) for a custom actions template repository.

## Writing Flows with Autocomplete

[![language server](https://img.shields.io/badge/language_server-blue)](https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows-lsp)

For an easier time writing flows, use YAML Language Server in your editor with the [asyncflows Language Server](https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows-lsp).

1. Install the [asyncflows Language Server](https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows-lsp)

2. Put the following line at the top of your YAML flow config file.
This will trigger the language server, but also provide rudimentary JsonSchema checks if it's not enabled.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/main/schemas/asyncflows_schema.json
```

## Caching with Redis

By default, AsyncFlows caches action outputs with a shelve file in a temporary directory.

To cache between runs, we support Redis as a backend:

1. Run [Redis](https://redis.io/download) locally or use a cloud provider.

2. Set the following environment variables:

- `REDIS_HOST` (required)
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` (required)
- `REDIS_PORT` (optional, defaults to 6379)
- `REDIS_USERNAME` (optional, defaults to empty string)

3. Override the default cache with:

```python
from asyncflows import AsyncFlows, RedisCacheRepo

flow = AsyncFlows.from_file(
   "flow.yaml",
   cache_repo=RedisCacheRepo,
)
```

## Setting up Ollama for Local Inference

To run the examples, you need to have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running locally.

1. [Download and Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) 
2. On some platforms like macOS Ollama runs in the background automatically. 
   If not, start it with:

```bash
ollama serve
```

3. Pull the `ollama/llama3` model (or the model you plan to use):

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

That's it! You're ready to run the examples.

## Using Any Language Model

You may set `api_base` under `default_model` to change the Ollama API endpoint:

```yaml
default_model:
  model: ollama/llama3
  api_base: ...
```

Alternatively, you can change the `model` in the corresponding YAML file to e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo` (an OpenAI model), or `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (an Anthropic model).
If you do, run the example with the corresponding api key environment variable.

You may also use any other model available via [litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).
Please note that most litellm models do not have async support, and will block the event loop during inference.

<details>
<summary>
OpenAI Example
</summary>

```yaml
default_model:
  model: gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Running the example with an OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... python -m asyncflows.examples.hello_world
```

</details>



<details>
<summary>
Anthropic Example
</summary>

```yaml
default_model:
  model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
```

Running the example with an Anthropic API key:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... python -m asyncflows.examples.hello_world
```

</details>

## Prompting in-depth

The `prompt` action constructs a prompt from a list of text and variables, and sends it to the LLM.

The simplest prompt contains a single string:

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: "Can you say hello world for me?"
```

Each string in the prompt is a jinja template.
A more complicated prompt includes a variable:
    
```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: "Can you say hello to {{ name }}?"
```

It's also possible to reference other actions' results in the template:

```yaml
name_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: "What's your name?"
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: "Can you say hello to {{ name_prompt.result }}?"
```

Often-times, the prompt is more complex, and includes multiple variables in a multi-line string.

The following two prompts are **equivalent**, but the second one uses syntactic sugar for referring to the `sample_text` variable:

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: |
        A writing sample:
        ```
        {{ sample_text }}
        ```

        Write a story about {{ subject }} in the style of the sample.
```

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - heading: A writing sample
      var: sample_text
    - text: Write a story about {{ subject }} in the style of the sample.
```

For generating well-formatted output, it is often useful to persuade the language model to generate a response wrapped in XML tags.
Prompting with XML tags often makes such a response better.

The `prompt` action can use the `quote_style` parameter to specify how to format variables in a prompt.
Specifically, `xml` will wrap the variable in XML tags instead of triple-backticks.

The two prompts below are **equivalent**:

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: |
        <writing sample>
        {{ sample_text }}
        </writing sample>
        
        Write a story about {{ subject }} in the style of the sample, placing it between <story> and </story> tags.
```

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  quote_style: xml
  prompt: 
    - heading: writing sample
      var: sample_text
    - text: |
        Write a story about {{ subject }} in the style of the sample, placing it between <story> and </story> tags.
```

From this prompt's response, extract the story with the `extract_xml_tag` action:

```yaml
extract_story:
  action: extract_xml_tag
  tag: story
  text:
    link: my_prompt.result
```

Lastly, using roles (system and user messages) is easy. 
Simply append `role: system` or `role: user` to a text element, or use it as a standalone element.

The following two prompts are **equivalent**:

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - role: system
      text: You are a detective investigating a crime scene.
    - role: user
      text: What do you see?
```

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - role: system
    - text: You are a detective investigating a crime scene.
    - role: user
    - text: What do you see?
```
