# Introduction

asyncflows is a framework for designing and running AI pipelines using simple YAML configuration.

Here is a simple flow that prompts the LLM to say "hello world", and prints the result.

<div align="center">

<img width="465" alt="hello world" src="https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/assets/24586651/b02a447b-7e86-4abc-a94a-5e276eff5dd6">

</div>

YAML file that defines the flow:
```yaml
# hello_world.yaml

default_model:
  model: ollama/llama3
flow:
  hello_world:
    action: prompt
    prompt:
      - text: Can you say hello world for me?
default_output: hello_world.result
```

Python code that runs the flow:
```python
from asyncflows import AsyncFlows

flow = AsyncFlows.from_file("hello_world.yaml")
result = await flow.run()
print(result)
```

Output of the python script:
```python
Hello, world!
```

Run the example yourself with:

```bash
python -m asyncflows.examples.hello_world
```

> pizza in space

Heya spacie peeps! Its me, Zlorg, yer favret pizza enthusiast from Andromeda! Im here to rite a tale abowt da most tubular pizzas eva sent into da cosmos!

In da year 3050, da Pizza Federation (ya, thats what we call dem) launched its first-ever space-bound pizzaria, aptly named "Crust-ial Velocity." Captain Zara and her trusty crew of pizza artisans, including da infamous topping master, Rizzo, set off on a quest to deliver da most cosmic pies to da galaxy's most distant planets.

First stop: da planet Zorvath, where da alien inhabitants were famished for some good ol' Earth-style pepperoni. Captain Zara and crew whipped up a "Galactic Garage Band" pizza, topped with spicy peppers from da swamps of Saturn, mozzarella from da moon of Ganymede, and a drizzle of da finest olive oil from da vineyards of Mars. Da Zorvathians went wild, chanting "Pizza-za-zee!" in their native tongue.

## De Bono's Six Thinking Hats

[Edward De Bono's Six Thinking Hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats) is a **business intelligence** technique for creative problem-solving and **decision support**.
The concept is based on the idea of using different colored hats to represent different modes of thinking, each focusing on a specific aspect of the problem or decision at hand.

This flow parallelizes the thinking under five hats, and synthesizes them under the blue hat.

<div align="center">

<img width="1079" alt="debono" src="https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/assets/24586651/0768b653-efbf-44ce-b9ae-53dae6266a30">

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This flow facilitates asking questions over a set of documents.

Given a list of texts, it uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to find the ones relevant to the question, and generates an answer.

The form of RAG we're using is **retrieval** followed by **reranking**.
Retrieval is great for searching through a large dataset, while reranking is slower but better at matching against the query.

<div align="center">
<img width="1104" alt="rag" src="https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/assets/24586651/a309f16a-7a84-4d73-be75-c4d0bb5abbe2">

> What's something healthy I could make?

The two provided recipes, Mexican Guacamole and Lebanese Hummus, offer healthy and flavorful options to prepare. The key points are:

1. Guacamole is made by mashing ripe avocados and mixing in fresh vegetables like onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and jalape√±os, along with lime juice and salt. It can be served with tortilla chips or as a topping for tacos.

2. Hummus is a blend of chickpeas, tahini (sesame seed paste), lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil, seasoned with salt and cumin. It is typically served as a dip with warm pita bread and garnished with paprika and parsley.

Both recipes are healthy, vegetarian options that incorporate fresh ingredients and can be easily prepared at home.

## Chatbot

[![template](https://img.shields.io/badge/template-blue)](https://github.com/asynchronous-flows/pdf-chatbot-example)

This flow facilitates a chatbot over a set of PDF documents.

Given a list of filepaths, it extracts their text, uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to find the ones relevant to the question, and generates an answer.

The form of RAG we're using is **retrieval** followed by **reranking**.
Retrieval is great for searching through a large dataset, while reranking is slower but better at matching against the query.

> How does the Red Queen's view of punishment shape the story?

The Red Queen's view of punishment is a significant theme that shapes the story of Wonderland. In the Relevant Pages, we see her ordering the beheading of Alice, three gardeners, and others without hesitation or remorse. Her fury is intense, and she screams "Off with her head!" with an air of absolute authority.

The Red Queen's perspective on punishment reveals a stark contrast between her cruel nature and the more benevolent attitudes of other characters, such as the King, who intervenes to save Alice from execution. The Queen's actions also create a sense of danger and chaos, making Wonderland an unpredictable and potentially deadly place for its inhabitants.

## Writing your own actions

You can create custom actions by subclassing `Action` and defining the input and output models using Pydantic.

Python code for the custom action:
```python
from asyncflows import Action, BaseModel, Field

import aiohttp


class Inputs(BaseModel):
    url: str = Field(
        description="URL of the webpage to GET",
    )


class Outputs(BaseModel):
    result: str = Field(
        description="Text content of the webpage",
    )


class GetURL(Action[Inputs, Outputs]):
    name = "get_url"

    async def run(self, inputs: Inputs) -> Outputs:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(inputs.url) as response:
                return Outputs(result=await response.text())
```

YAML file of an example flow using this action:
```yaml
# get_page_title.yaml

default_model:
  model: ollama/llama3
flow:
  get_website:
    action: get_url
    url: 
      var: url
  extract_title:
    action: prompt
    prompt:
      - heading: Website content
        link: get_website.result
      - text: |
          What is the title of the webpage?
default_output: extract_title.result
```

<details>
<summary>

Python script that runs the flow:
```python
from asyncflows import AsyncFlows

flow = AsyncFlows.from_file("soup.yaml")

# Run the flow and return the default output (result of the extract_title action)
result = await flow.set_vars(
    url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)",
).run()
print(result)
```

Output of the python script:
```
The title of the webpage is "Python (programming language) - Wikipedia".
```

# Guides

## Writing Flows with Autocomplete

For an easier time writing flows, use YAML Language Server in your editor with our JsonSchema.

Put the following at the top of your YAML flow config file:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asynchronous-flows/asyncflows/main/schemas/action_schema.json
```

The JsonSchema will only catch some errors, 
stay tuned for a domain-specific language server that will provide more advanced features.

## Setting up Ollama for Local Inference

To run the examples, you need to have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running locally.

1. [Download and Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) 
2. On some platforms like macOS Ollama runs in the background automatically. 
   If not, start it with:

```bash
ollama serve
```

3. Pull the `ollama/llama3` model (or the model you plan to use):

```bash
ollama pull ollama/llama3
```

That's it! You're ready to run the examples.

## Using Any Language Model

You may set `api_base` under `default_model` to change the Ollama API endpoint:

```yaml
default_model:
  model: ollama/llama3
  api_base: ...
```

Alternatively, you can change the `model` in the corresponding YAML file to e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo` (an OpenAI model), or `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (an Anthropic model).
If you do, run the example with the corresponding api key environment variable.

You may also use any other model available via [litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).
Please note that most litellm models do not have async support, and will block the event loop during inference.

```yaml
default_model:
  model: gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Running the example with an OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... python -m asyncflows.examples.hello_world
```

## Prompting in-depth

The `prompt` action constructs a prommpt from a list of text and variables, and sends it to the LLM.

The simplest prompt contains a single string:

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: "Can you say hello world for me?"
```

Each string in the prompt is a jinja template.
A more complicated prompt includes a variable:
    
```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: "Can you say hello to {{ name }}?"
```

It's also possible to reference other actions' results in the template:

```yaml
name_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: "What's your name?"
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: "Can you say hello to {{ name_prompt.result }}?"
```

Often-times, the prompt is more complex, and includes multiple strings and variables in a multi-line string:

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: |
        A writing sample:
        ```
        {{ sample_text }}
        ```

        Write a story about {{ subject }} in the style of the sample.
```

The following prompt is **equivalent** to the prompt above, but using syntactic sugar for referring to the `sample_text` variable:

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - heading: A writing sample
      var: sample_text
    - text: Write a story about {{ subject }} in the style of the sample.
```

For generating well-formatted output, it is often useful to persuade the language model to generate a response wrapped in XML tags.
Prompting with XML tags often makes such a response better.

The `prompt` action can use the `quote_style` parameter to specify how to format variables in a prompt.
Specifically, `xml` will wrap the variable in XML tags instead of triple-backticks.

The two prompts below are **equivalent**:

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - text: |
        <writing sample>
        {{ sample_text }}
        </writing sample>
        
        Write a story about {{ subject }} in the style of the sample, placing it between <story> and </story> tags.
```

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  quote_style: xml
  prompt: 
    - heading: writing sample
      var: sample_text
    - text: |
        Write a story about {{ subject }} in the style of the sample, placing it between <story> and </story> tags.
```

From this prompt, extract the story with the `extract_xml_tag` action:

```yaml
extract_story:
  action: extract_xml_tag
  tag: story
  text:
    link: my_prompt.result
```

Lastly, using roles (system and user messages) is easy. 
Simply append `role: system` or `role: user` to a text element, or use it as a standalone element.

The following two prompts are **equivalent**:

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - role: system
      text: You are a detective investigating a crime scene.
    - role: user
      text: What do you see?
```

```yaml
my_prompt:
  action: prompt
  prompt: 
    - role: system
    - text: You are a detective investigating a crime scene.
    - role: user
    - text: What do you see?
```
